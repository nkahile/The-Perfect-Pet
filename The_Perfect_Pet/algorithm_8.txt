Steps;
-create a attribute that will hold an arrayList of values, wer will also have two functions one is decreaseValue and the other one is increaseValue and the idea behind this is
to control the status of every animal for example of the animal is hungry and you give him food there are going to be a list of strings and based on if you give him food or not
his hunger is either going to increase in value or decrease in value, to be more specific if we will have 4 strings (happy,kinda happy,sad,very sad) and the decrease or increase
are going to be decided bas on that
-then we will create various classes with an attribute type
-and then the user class is going to control and print everything out.
